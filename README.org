An Emacs config intended for Neovim users with a IDE-like experience.
* Requirements
This configuration assumes at least GNU Emacs 29.1 with built-in tree-sitter (=treesit=), LSP (=eglot=), and =use-package=.  It also assumes a build environment is setup and available to it for native builds of some packages.  In addition, it also currently assumes certain additional tools are installed such as specific tree-sitter language implementations and some LSP servers.
