# Vimacs.app, The Opinionated Emacs Config For Those Who Want a Little More From Their Editor

Vimacs.app is an opinionated Emacs config with an IDE-like experience intended for Neovim users seeking a platform with a more integrated mechanism for customization.  This config attempts to meld the quick, powerful editing conventions of Vim with the extensibility and power of Emacs while aiming for modern development environment sensibilities like LSP and DAP.
